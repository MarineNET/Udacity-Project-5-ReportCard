# Udacity-Project-5-ReportCard
This is NOT a functioning Android app. This project simply tested the knowledge of JAVA Object Oriented nature, and how well I understood
how to build a new class with a constructor, getters, setters, and how to Override a method. I have created this method using MVP parameters
so it is very basic and simple.
